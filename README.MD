# K03

- 34 keys.
- Diodeless.
- Low profile.
- Non-hotswap.
- Reversible PCB.
- Column staggered.
- Wireless and wired capable.
- Small PCB size (less than 10,0mm x 10,0mm)
- Choc CFX spaced (16,5mm x 16,5mm).
- Cheaper than the [cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino) (at the time of the build).

### What I'm working on<sup>1</sup>:

- Partial trackpoint integration.
- Create an [assembly manual]().
- Add commissioned art by the brazilian artist [Aline Dal Pont](https://www.instagram.com/manifesto.efemero/).

> <sup>1</sup> The main reason for not doing this at the moment is the lack of financial motivation. As I have to pay for every prototype and take time off to do the development and iterations I have to be mindful of the tasks I take.

## Production

The [gerber files are in the release section.](https://github.com/anothermimich/K03/releases)

## Firmware

This board like the [K02](https://github.com/anothermimich/K02) maintain the pin out of the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) so you can use any compatible keymap/firmware.

Currenty I'm using the above [zmk](https://zmk.dev/) keymap, you can replicate it with [this files](https://github.com/anothermimich/zmk-config-k02).
